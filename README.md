A little angular app I'm hacking on to get a bit better with Angularjs.

## TODO

### Bootstrapping

- [x] Get bower up and running and use it for dependency fetching
- [ ] Add angularjs to application
- [ ] Add bootstrap to application (cuz I'm a lot of things but a designer isn't one of them.)
- [ ] Use requirejs for dependency setting (or whatever Angularjs recommends for DI)
- [ ] Wire in testing framework (Karma, mocha, chai, whatever)

### Application Features

- [ ] List page with all saved characters, links to view/edit page
- [ ] Creation page with the appropriate fields
- [ ] View/Edit page with character details
